# p5.js multi sketch template
I chose a facial recognition filter that displays fun effects similar to Instagram's selfie filters. I began by drawing the bow on the iPad and then exported it in PNG format. I imported the image into Visual Studio Code  using the method we learned last week, and then adjusted the picture to the appropriate position while reducing the scale.
Here is the drawing of the bow.

This is the sketches effect I want it to show on my face.

I find it challenging to adjust the size of the bow when I'm in various positions relative to the lens. Additionally, I'm curious about how filters like those in Instagram are created and whether I can learn some of their techniques. These filters often enhance users' appearances by adding attractive effects.
